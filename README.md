# Otonomo Exercise
Welcome to Otonomo, this repo contains a boilerplate for a short front end exercise.

In order to save some time, we have already initiated this repo with `create-react-app` and several basic components. 

## Instruction
You can start by forking this repo, complete the exercise and send us the a link to the forked repo.

## App Specification
Otonomo is collecting real-time car data, for example, fuel level, wiper fluid level, geolocation, etc.

In this exercise you should develop a tiny web app through which users can subscribe to vehicle events and display them in real time. Users should also be able to filter those events based on VIN (Vehicle Identification Number - basically car ID) and fuel level - in some cases users would like to know if the car fuel level is below certain threshold (for this exercise it will always be **15%**). 

The basic idea is fairly simple:
- [ ] Users can subscribe to VIN by entering the VIN and adding it to the watch list
- [ ] Events from those vehicles should be displayed in the main screen
- [ ] Users can turn off events from specific VINs
- [ ] Users can filter events by fuel level, displaying only events in which the fuel level is below 15%

This is how it should look like (roughly):

## Subscribing to events
We are using a `Streamer` instance to mock car events, nothing too fancy, just a class that receives a factory function and emits its output once in a while.

You can initiate such `Streamer` by importing `createCarStreamer` function from `car-data-streamer`, it receives a `VIN` (17 uppercase alphanumeric characters) and returns a streamer, like so:
```
import createCarStreamer from './api/car-data-streamer'

const carStreamer = createCarStreamer('IFJRU974JFI100JC')
carStreamer.start()
```
	
	
### Streamer.subscribe(handler)
This is how you subscribe to car events:
```
carStreamer.subscribe(carData => {
	// do something with car data
})
```

`carData` structure:
```
 return {
    vin, // the vin you entered
    timestamp: 43904830948, // event timestamp
    fuel: 0.23, // fuel level (max is 1)
    wiperFluid: 0.69, // wiper fluid level (max is 1)
    location: {lat: 34.94585948, lng: 48.48348}, // car coordinates
  }
```

### Streamer.start()
Will start to emit car events

### Streamer.stop()
You guessed it, will pause events emitting :)

### Streamer.removeHandler(handler)
Unsubscribe from car events

## Utility Components
Some of the required components has already been added for you:
- `Button`
- `Checkbox`
- `Input`
- `EventNotification` - this is a styled box that contains a single car event

You can play with the components by running `npm run storybook`

## App Mockup 
We really recommend you to focus on the app functionality rather than styling. After everything is working, it'd be great if you can make it look better (as a bonus)

That's it, it should take no more than an hour or two, good luck!
